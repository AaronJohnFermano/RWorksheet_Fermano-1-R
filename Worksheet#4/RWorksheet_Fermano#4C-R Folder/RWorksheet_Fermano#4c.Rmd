#2.
#2a. What does ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point() show?

#This ggplot command creates a scatter plot where each point represents a car model, positioned along the x-axis by the model name and along the y-axis by the manufacturer.

#2b. Is it useful? If not, how could you modify the data to make it more informative?

#The plot may be useful for visualizing the distribution of models across manufacturers, but it could be crowded and hard to interpret if there are many models.
