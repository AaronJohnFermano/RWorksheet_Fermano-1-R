#1.Use the dataset mpg

#1b. Which variables from mpg dataset are categorical?

#1c. Which are continuous variables?

#2. Which manufacturer has the most models in this data set? Which model has the most variations? Show your answer.

#2a. Group the manufacturers and find the unique models. Show your codes and result.

#2b. Graph the result by using plot() and ggplot(). Write the codes and its result
library(ggplot2)

#2.
#2a. What does ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point() show?

#This ggplot command creates a scatter plot where each point represents a car model, positioned along the x-axis by the model name and along the y-axis by the manufacturer.

#2b. Is it useful? If not, how could you modify the data to make it more informative?

#The plot may be useful for visualizing the distribution of models across manufacturers, but it could be crowded and hard to interpret if there are many models.
