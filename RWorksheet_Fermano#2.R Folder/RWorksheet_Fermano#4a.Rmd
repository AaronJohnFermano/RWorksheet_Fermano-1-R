## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


#1 The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame.

Household_data <- data.frame(
Shoe_size = c(6.5, 9.0, 8.5, 8.5, 10.5, 7.0, 9.5, 9.0, 13.0, 7.5, 10.5, 8.5, 12.0, 10.5, 13.0, 11.5, 8.5, 5.0, 10.0, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 10.5, 8.5, 10.5, 11.0, 9.0, 13.0),
Height = c(66.0, 68.0, 64.5, 65.0, 70.0, 64.0, 70.0, 71.0, 72.0, 64.0, 74.2, 67.0, 71.0, 71.0, 77.0, 72.0, 59.0, 62.0, 72.0, 66.0, 64.0, 67.0, 73.0, 69.0, 72.0, 70.0, 69.0, 70.0 ),
Gender = c("F", "F", "F", "F", "M", "F","F", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "M", "M", "M", "F", "F", "M", "F", "F", "M", "M", "F", "M", "M", "M", "M")
)
Household_data

#1a. Describe the data.

#1b. Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height. What its result? Show the R scripts.
submale <- subset(Household_data, Gender == "M", select =
c(Shoe_size, Height))

subfema <- subset(Household_data, Gender == "F", select =
c(Shoe_size, Height))

#1c. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result.
meansiz <- mean(Household_data$Shoe_size)
meansiz

meanhei <- mean(Household_data$Height)
meanhei

#1d. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?

#2.Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to factor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out the factor levels below the actual values.
nammonths <- c("March","April","January","November","January",
"September","October","September","November","August",
"January","November","November","February","May","August","July","December","August","August","September","November","February","April")
nammonths

factor_nammonths <- factor(nammonths)
factor_nammonths

#3. Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. Interpret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case? 
summary(factor_nammonths)

#4. Create a vector and factor for the table below.

DiFunc <- data.frame(
  Direction = c("East","West","North"),
  Frequency = c("1","4","3")
)
DiFunc
#5. Enter the data below in Excel with file name = import_march.csv

#5a. Import the excel file into the Environment Pane using read.table() function. Write the code.

#5b. View the dataset. Write the R scripts and its result.
