## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


#1. There is a built-in vector LETTERS contains the uppercase letters of the alphabet and letters which contains the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
Alpine1 <- LETTERS[1:26]
Alpine1
Alpine2 <- letters[1:26]
Alpine2

#1a You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters.
Oneeleven1 <- Alpine1[1:11]
Oneeleven2 <- Alpine2[1:11]
Oneeleven1
Oneeleven2

#1b Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.
Oddis1 <- Alpine1[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
Oddis2 <- Alpine2[c(TRUE, FALSE)]

#1c Produce a vector that contains the vowels.
Vowvec1 <- Alpine1[c(1,5,9,15,21)]
Vowvec2 <- Alpine2[c(1,5,9,15,21)]

#1d Produce a vector that contains the last 5 lowercase letters.
Veclow1 <- Alpine2[c(22:26)]

#1e Produce a vector that contains letters between 15 to 24 letters in lowercase.
Veclow2 <- Alpine2[c(15:24)]
