## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


#1. There is a built-in vector LETTERS contains the uppercase letters of the alphabet and letters which contains the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
Alpine1 <- LETTERS[1:26]
Alpine1
Alpine2 <- letters[1:26]
Alpine2

#1a You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters.
Oneeleven1 <- Alpine1[1:11]
Oneeleven2 <- Alpine2[1:11]
Oneeleven1
Oneeleven2

#1b Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.
Oddis1 <- Alpine1[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
Oddis2 <- Alpine2[c(TRUE, FALSE)]

#1c Produce a vector that contains the vowels.
Vowvec1 <- Alpine1[c(1,5,9,15,21)]
Vowvec2 <- Alpine2[c(1,5,9,15,21)]

#1d Produce a vector that contains the last 5 lowercase letters.
Veclow1 <- Alpine2[c(22:26)]

#1e Produce a vector that contains letters between 15 to 24 letters in lowercase.
Veclow2 <- Alpine2[c(15:24)]

#2Create a vector(not a dataframe) with the average temperatures in April for Tugue-garao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban, Samal Island, and Davao City. The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.

#2a. What is the R code and its result for creating a character vector for the city/town of Tuguegarao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban,Samal Island, and Davao City? Name the object as city. The names should follow the same order as in the instruction.
Namcit <- c("Tuguegarao City", "Manila", "Iloilo City", "Tacloban", "Samal Island", "Davao City")
Namcit

#2b. The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.Name the object as temp. Write the R code and its output. Numbers should also follow what is in the instruction.
Avetem <- c(42, 39, 34, 34, 30, 27)
Avetem

#2c. Create a dataframe to combine the city and the temp by using ‘data.frame(). What the R code and its result?
comcit <- data.frame(City = Namcit, Temperature = Avetem)
comcit

#2d. Associate the dataframe you have created in 2.(c) by naming the columns using the names() function. Change the column names by using names() function as City andTemperature. What is the R code and its result?
names(comcit) <- c("City", "Temperature")
View(comcit)

#2e. Print the structure by using str() function. Describe the output.
str(comcit)

#2f. From the answer in d, what is the content of row 3 and row 4 What is its R code and its output?
rowtefor <- comcit[3:4, ]
rowtefor

#2g. From the answer in d, display the city with highest temperature and the city with the lowest temperature. What is its R code and its output?
higtem <- comcit[comcit$Temperature == max(comcit$Temperature), ]
higtem

lowtem <- comcit[comcit$Temperature == min(comcit$Temperature), ]
lowtem

arrnum

#3b. How many dimensions do your array have?
dimarr <- arrnum * 2
dimarr

#3c. Name the rows as lowercase letters and columns as uppercase letters starting from the A. The array names should be “1st-Dimensional Array”, “2nd-Dimensional Array”, and “3rd-Dimensional Array”. What will be the R codes and its output?
